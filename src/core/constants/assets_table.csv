1,LPG Feed Chiller,HBA-6000,Heat exchanger - Multi stream,"Under normal operation, dry gas from the Gas Dehydration System is sent tothe LPG Feed Chiller at a flow rate of around 340 MMSCFD and conditions of approximately 923 psig and 92 °F. When required, the entire LPG system can be bypassed upstream of the LPG Feed Chiller, and the dry gas routed straight to the Export Gas Compressor. When in by-pass operation the LPG components will not have been removed from the gas stream, resulting in the possible accumulation of liquids in the EGC. The LPG Feed Chiller is an aluminum multi-stream exchanger cold box that cools the incoming feed stream to around -11 °F using recycle streams from the De-ethanizer Overhead Condenser and the liquid outlet from the LPG HP Separator. Liquids condense out of the feed stream, which is fed to the LPG HP Separator that operates around -11 °F and 915 psig. The gas from the separator is fed to the Turbo-Expanders, and the liquids are recycled under level control, back to the LPG Feed Chiller. The conditions of the liquid  recycle stream at the inlet and outlet to the feed chiller are around 310 psig at -45 °F and 305 psig at 85 °F, respectively. The stream coming to the LPG Feed Chiller from the De-ethanizer Overhead Condenser originates at the Absorption Tower Overheads, and is heated in the feed chiller from -68 °F to 82 °F and is then fed to the Recompressors. The liquid stream from the LPG HP Separator that was heated to 85 °F in the LPG Feed Chiller and contains the bulk of the LPG components is fed directly to the middle of the De-ethanizer."
2,LPG HP Separator,MBD-8230,separator,"There is one 100% Turbo-Expander / Compressors that decompress the gas from the LPG HP Separator from -11 °F at 910 psig to -99 °F at 280 psig on the turbo-expander side, and compress the lean gas from 264 psig at 82 °F to 395 psig at 145 °F on the recompressor side. The lean gas from the discharge of the recompressor is cooled to 105 °F by the Recompressor Discharge Cooler before being sent to the Export Gas Compressor. There is a pressure control valve that bypasses the turbo-expanders which uses the Joules-Thompson (J-T) effect to cool the gas, but it does not match the turbo-expanders in terms of effectiveness. The J-T valve is used at start- up and at times when the turbo-expanders are out of service to avoid a sudden shutdown of the LPG system. The recovery rates of LPG when running in J-T mode are a fraction of the normal rates achieved when using the Turbo-Expanders. The operating pressures downstream of the J-T valve are also around 121psi higher than when using the Turbo-Expanders."

6,Absorption Tower,MBA-7975,Absorption,"The chilled gas from the turbo-expanders is fed to the base of the Absorption Tower where it flows upwards countercurrent to the partially-condensed overheads from the De-ethanizer tower. The liquid flowing down the Absorption Tower absorbs any of the remaining heavier components in the gas that were not removed as liquids in the LPG HP Separator. The gas leaving the top of the Absorption Tower is at 273 psig and -115°F, with a very lean composition, consisting principally of methane and ethane. This cold, lean gas is fed to the De-Ethanizer Overhead Condenser (another aluminum multi-stream exchanger) where it is used to partially condense the De- ethanizer overheads whilst being heated to around -69 °F. The lean gas then flows to the LPG Feed Chiller where it is heated further before reaching the recompressors"

The operating pressure of this column is between 294 and 297 psig. The overhead streams contain principally methane and ethane, and is partially condensed by the De-ethanizer Overhead Condenser.
